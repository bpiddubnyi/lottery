# Lottery

Simple client-server lottery game. No real life usage expected.

## Install

```sh
go get -u github.com/bpiddubnyi/lottery/cmd/...
```

## Usage

Lottery distribution contains two binaries: `lotteryd` (server) and `lotteryc` (client). One can get usage details for each binary  with `-h` command line argument. Anyway, sane default settings are provided.
